Not Bored is a site dedicated to nothing more that me providing my thoughts and ideas to anyone interested in them. I'm always trying to be better at what I do, how I think, and how I act. This leads to a lot of introspection which leads to a desire to share my thoughts.

After a 23 year career in application development, architecture, and management, I transitioned into information security in 2018.  

Working in financial services taught me the value of working on the blue team and understanding the business side of information security. During my blue team tenure, I acted as a Security Architect, Identity Managment Lead, and built an Application Security program.  

In 2020 I took my leave of the blue side and became security consultant after having earned my GWEB, GSSP-.NET, GWAPT, and GPEN from the SANS Institute.
